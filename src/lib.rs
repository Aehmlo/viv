/// This macro takes two arguments: a hoorizontal and vertical position (in that order).
///
/// ### Examples
/// ```
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate viv;
/// # use viv::Index;
/// let idx = index!(0, 0);
/// assert_eq!(idx, Index::origin());
/// ```

/// ### Construction
/// The [`index!`](macro.index.html) macro is recommended for construction of indices.

/// ### Notes
/// This type is intended to be more-or-less opaque.
